= Introduction =

Starfighter is a spaceship traveling through a field of meteors in an attempt to stop an incoming enemy fleet.

The game features a simple bullet hell that's easy enough for beginners yet still moderately challenging for those with experience.

The player must make it to the end of the game by destroying meteors and enemies before facing the final boss.  Along the way, 
the player can increase their health and power with power-ups to complete their mission.
